# Liferay Go SDK

This repository contains a version of the [Liferay Mobile SDK]
(https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk) written in the [Go]
(http://golang.org) language.

The Liferay Go SDK is an accurate port of the [Android]
(https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/tree/master/android) version and
can be considered feature-complete. Nevertheless, even if it's covered by the
same unit tests of the official Liferay Mobile SDK, it was created just for fun
and basically as an experiment. Your mileage may vary.

## Setup

To install the Liferay Go SDK, simply run:

```bat
go get github.com/ithildir/liferay-sdk-go/liferay
```

Alternatively, the source code of the SDK for Liferay 6.2 is available in the
[*liferay*] (https://github.com/Ithildir/liferay-sdk-go/tree/master/liferay)
folder.

The SDK has been developed and tested with Go version 1.3 and 1.4, but it's
probably compatible with 1.1+ versions as well.
